Proofs of concept successful.
    Database model created on MySQL Workbench.
    Model was forward engineered onto local MySQL and onto AWS RDS MySQL instance.
    Hompage index.php took data from local and AWS MySQL instances and displayed through PDO.

    Test of hand-made classes unsuccessfull. Database connection is good and there is no syntax error. Not resolved:
    Valid PDOStatement was being created successfully but returning False when PDOStatement->fetch() was called.
    Suspicious:
    Lines 32, 40, and 44 in DBManager tirggered Notice: Only variables should be passed by reference.

    Hand-made classes working.
    - Modified Configuration file. Variables declared outside of a class are not accessible to it or its methods/funcitons. Had to modify Configuration.php.
    - Result of PDOStatement->fetch() were false because of missing PDOStatement->execute(). Tested using verfied correct SQL statement. The fetch() method will only succeed if execute has previously been called. It implies that the PDOStatement instance object is modified after a call to execute, allowing fetch to work.

    Result of PDOStatement->execute() is traversable. When traversing a PDOStatement object element-wise after a successful return of results, each element is returned as an associative array by default.
    Unable to create table for routes.
